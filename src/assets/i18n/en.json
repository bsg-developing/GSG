  "water-description": "The water-to-water heat pump is one of the most efficient heating systems. The key factor for its high efficiency lies in the energy source — specifically, the groundwater it uses.",
  "heat" : "Just like all other heat pumps, the ground-to-water heat pump operates on the same principle: First, thermal energy is extracted from the ground and then transferred to the refrigerant. The refrigerant evaporates and is further compressed by a compressor. This increases not only its pressure but also its temperature. The resulting heat is absorbed by a heat exchanger (condenser) and transferred to the heating system.",
  "air" : "The air-to-water heat pump brings heat from the ambient air into the room. More precisely, a fan actively draws in the ambient air and transfers it to an air heat exchanger (evaporator) built into the heat pump. Inside it, a circulating refrigerant changes its physical state at low temperatures and evaporates. To raise these refrigerant vapors to a level that can be used for heating and for domestic hot water, they are compressed using a compressor.",
